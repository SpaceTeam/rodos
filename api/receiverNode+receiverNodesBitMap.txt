In RODOS network messages are normally sent in broadcast to all nodes and
each receiver (node) selects the topics which it needs and discard all other
messages. This work nice for radio-links, bus-systems and shared memory.
For Networks with routers or point-to-point connections broadcast is bad.

Each node has an Application "distributed-topic-register" which has 2 sides:
1. “TopicPublisher” distributes a list of topics to which it has subscribers.
This list is encoded in a message of type TopicListPerNode and distributed
in the topic topicListDistribution which has an ID 1 and shall always be
distributed in Broadcast.
2. “TopicCollector” receives reports from TopicList and register in each
local TopicInterface a list of nodes which have subscriber to it (to the topic)

Each of the classes
    TopicInterface 
    NetMsgInfo and
    NetworkMessage
has the fields 
    receiverNode and 
    receiverNodesBitMap
where it is encoded how to route the message in the network.
Rodos prepare this fields but do not use them.  The content is
first written (distributed-topic-register)  in TopicInterface and from there
transferred (copied) to NetMsgInfo and then the gateway copies it again
from NetMsgInfo to NetworkMessage and then the gate ways sends the message.

And yes, these fields they are somehow redundant.
For now we assume we have maximal 32 Nodes (our biggest network up to
now was 20 nodes). (if you need 64, talk to us).
If there are 0 external subscriber (receiverNodesBitMap equals 0) for a topic,
then the gateway will not forward the corresponding message.

If there is only one receiver, then its node-Id (or node index) will be
written in receiverNode. In case there is no reciever then -2 and in case
of more than 1 receiver this field contains -1.
Simple Routers need just to see this field and send directly to the
corresponding (channel/node) or, if -1 then send broadcast.
The field receiverNodesBitMap is a 32 bit integer (a bitmap),
where each bit represents a node index. A bit in 1 means the node
with the same index like the bit has at least one subscriber for this topic.
More intelligent router can use this field for a multicast distribution.


(Point to Point is a subset of this method.
In case there is only one subscriber for a topic
then we have automatically a point to point connection.)
