 Using SNPRINTF to protect from out of bounds memory access:

 For this test let's assume we only have 4 Bytes of Buffer
 We will print "Hello World" in there.
 If we only use our memory, we will only "Hel" and the trailing \0

 Using SPRINTF we get: Hello World!
 OOPS! We did use memory outside of this buffer!

 Using SNPRINTF we get: Hel
 This time it worked!

 If you want to see what happens if the buffer is really that small, just change the buffer size.
 If you are lucky on your platform you get a segmentation fault, otherwise you just wrote memory that is not yours!
