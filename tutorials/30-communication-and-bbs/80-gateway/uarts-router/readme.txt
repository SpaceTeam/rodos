How to create a router/switch using UARTS (instead of Ethernet)

This is an example to implement a Router on a discovery board.

The router may have as many Ports as the Discovery Board
has UARTS -1 (6). But in this example we demonstrate it with only 3 Ports.

See src/router.cpp.
That is all! The rest is just to test it: One sender and two receivers.
